# IBMSAFR-Spark

This repository contains two POC projects conducted starting in 2015 (SAFR on Spark), and ngsafr, in 2018.  The SAFR on Spark POC was then included in the Unviversal Ledger POC in the Spring of 2019.

These POC provide source code and other materials relevant to the GenevaERS integration with Spark, and thus are contributed by IBM to the GenevaERS project.
