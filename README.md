# POC-Iterations

Many of the below POCs are only held in the archive project branch to avoid having to clean vulnerable dependent code.

## JZOS SPARK Test

This POC investigates integration of Spark with SAFR (GenevaERS) and was conducted in 2015.

## NGSAFR CKB

This is a Spark implementation of GenevaERS common key buffer and was done in 2018.

## UniversalLedger

Unviversal Ledger Spark POC was from Spring of 2019.

## JNI2ASM

JNI2ASM seeks to emulate the technique for calling IBM assembler using an example shown in the Longpela web site.

## Scala2ASM

This POC implements a mechanism for calling IBM assembler code from Scala and was done in 2020.

## ASMcallingJAVA

This POC builds upon the experience gained in JNI2ASM to do the opposite. That is to call a generalized Java Class and Method from a single or multi-threaded assembler program. The specific case here is enabling GenevaERS Performance Engine to dynamically call Java written "exits".


These POC provide source code and other materials relevant to the GenevaERS integration with Spark, and thus are contributed by IBM to the GenevaERS project.
