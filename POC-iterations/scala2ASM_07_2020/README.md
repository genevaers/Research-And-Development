# Scala to Assembler  Test

This subprogram is to test simple JNI processing from Scala, as the first step to try to call z/OS assembler from Scala using JNI

Trying to run JNI off the mainframe first, and then to transfer that to z/OS to establish environment work

This is a simple approach to doing JNI tests off of z/OS just to get [start on JNI work](https://medium.com/@bschlining/a-simple-java-native-interface-jni-example-in-java-and-scala-68fdafe76f5f)

## Environment
When we try to go to our z/OS environment, we will use the following libraries:

Java:  /Java
Scala:  /scala
Spark: /Spark
  Interactive shell is in /Spark/bin/spark-shell
