View Filtering
===============

The following are the steps that should be followed to prove View Filtering, both record level, and column level filtering.

(1) Record Level Filter.
This step is relatively easy.  The first view, aggregated amounts by Agency, should exclude all agencies titles
that contain the word "Department".  out of the sample data, this will exclude the "Department of Education - Central Office Operations"

(2) Column Filtering.
This requires a change to the output map of data from view one.  The view should now produce multiple columns of output
for each department, in this format.

Department Name:  Column 1 = Amounts from 2003,  Column 2 = Amounts from 2004, Column 3 = Amounts from 2005...etc, up to 2016

Thus if a Deparment has no data for a specific year, the amount should be zero.

So, rather than this:
106
	2003	10
	2004	20.34
	2005	5.45

I want this:
Depart	2003	2004	2005
106 	10	    20.34	5.45

Depart	Set1	Set2	Set3    Set4
106 	10	    20.34	5.45    35.79

View Piping
============

View piping should entail feeding the output from this newly formatted view one to another view.  In other words
Instead of our new view 4 reading either transactions or balances from the CKB, a new input "buffer" should be
created which is the result of (output from) view 1.

This new view, 4, should produce an output which is a simple accumulation of all columns (years) for each department.

Department Name:  Column 1 = Accumulated Spend by department.
