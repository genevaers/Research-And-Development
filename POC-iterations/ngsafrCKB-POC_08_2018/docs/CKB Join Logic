This logic is part of view processing.  New rows inserted below for View Processing with ---->

View Processing
    [This section of code is linked to and processed after each CKB buffer dump.]

    For each record in the collection for the specific view

        [views that process transactions against the transaction collection, balance views against
        balance records etc.]

        [View 1 Logic, aggregate all transactions, summing ammount by Agency Name]
        Select Agency Key field from transaction
        Search Agency Table for that key
        ----> Search CKB Vendor Buffer for Vendor Type
        Format Extract Record with Agency Name (from Agency Table) AND VENDOR TYPE (from Vendor Record) and amount
        [Historic SAFR does the aggregation by Agency Name in another phase...
        for purposes of this sprint, simply println formatted records]

        [View 2 Logic, aggregate all transactions, summing by Object Name
        Select Object Key field from transaction
        Search Object Table for that key
        Format Extract Record with Object Name (from Object Table) and amount
        [Println formatted extract record]
    Loop next Transaction record in CKB Collection
    [Note that in this case View 1 and View 2 could be executed in parallel,
    That can be done in a later sprint, but perhaps consider how to design for it]

    For each balance record in the CKB Collection
        [View 3 Logic, aggregate Balances by combination of Agency and Object Key]
        Select Agency Key field from Balance
        Search Agency Table for that key
        Select Object Key field from Balance
        Search Object Table for that key
        Format Extract record with Agency Name, Object Name, and Amount
        Println formatted extract record
    Loop next Balance record in CKB Collection
    [Note that in this instance each thread can be executed in Parallel]
End of View Processing, return to CKB Processing

Join using the Transaction Record to the Inst-ID value, and pull off Vendor Type-ID
