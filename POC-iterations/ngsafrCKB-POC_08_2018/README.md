This project is the Next Generation SAFR project, a POC on SAFR (later GenevaERS) Common Key Buffering functionality, coded in Scala.

More information about this POC can be found in this blog posting [Scala on z](https://ledgerlearning.com/2020/03/26/scala-on-z/)

The genScala module reads parameter files, such as MergeParms and a Logic Table, and generates a SAFR program to perform those functions.  

This POC was conducted in the summer of 2018, and team members include:
Kip Twitchell
Sibasis Das
Claire Zou Price
Steve Brown
